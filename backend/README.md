# **AWattPrice Backend**

The AWattPrice app needs to get the current power price data. This backend provides this data to the client by polling the public [aWATTar API](https://www.awattar.de/services/api). To offload the API it caches the price data locally. The backend also has multiple other purposes.

**Please see the `docs/` directory and specifically the `docs/general.md` file.**
